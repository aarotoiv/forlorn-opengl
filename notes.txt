ANIMATING THE DRAWING
_________________________
So, at the beginning of your rendering cycle, simply modify your box_vertices array as desired, then call the same thing as when you're putting data in for the first time:

glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO);
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(box_vertices), box_vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW)

GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW?
